# go-httpsignature[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dereulenspiegel/go-httpsignature.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dereulenspiegel/go-httpsignature)
This library should provide implementations for clients and servers for [HTTP Signature](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-00) authorization method.

It is a fork of Joyents [go-sign](https://github.com/joyent/gosign). But go-sign was rather specific to the use in combination
with SDC and Manta. This library adheres more strictly to the draft mentionend above.

## Installation
This library is 'go-gettable'

## Usage
